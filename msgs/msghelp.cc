"    Perforce client usage:\n"
"\n"
"    p4 [options] command [--explain] [arg ...]\n"
"    p4 -V\n"
"\n"
"	Many command flags have both short-form and long-form syntax. Specify\n"
"	the --explain flag to display additional information about the flags\n"
"	accepted by this command. For example, 'p4 sync --explain' to display\n"
"	all the options supported by sync, or 'p4 edit --explain -k' to\n"
"	display information about the -k flag to edit.\n"
"\n"
"	options:\n"
"	    -b batchsize -c client -C charset -d dir -H host\n"
"	    -I -G -L language -p port -P pass -q -r retries -s\n"
"	    -Q charset -u user -x file -z tag\n"
"\n"
"	The -b batchsize specifies a batch size (number of arguments) to\n"
"	use when processing a command from a file '-x' (default 128).\n"
"\n"
"	The -c flag specifies the client name, overriding the value of\n"
"	$P4CLIENT in the environment and the default (the hostname).\n"
"\n"
"	The -C flag specifies the client's character set, overriding the\n"
"	value of $P4CHARSET in the environment.  See 'p4 help charset'\n"
"	for more information.\n"
"\n"
"	The -d flag specifies the current directory, overriding the value of\n"
"	$PWD in the environment and the default (the current directory).\n"
"\n"
"	The -G flag formats all output (and batch input for form commands\n"
"	with -i) as marshalled Python dictionary objects.\n"
"\n"
"	The -H flag specifies the host name, overriding the value of\n"
"	$P4HOST in the environment and the default (the hostname).\n"
"\n"
"	The -I flag specifies that progress indicators, if available,\n"
"	are desired.  Progress indicators are available for the commands:\n"
"	'p4 -I submit', 'p4 -I sync -q', 'p4 -I switch', 'p4 clone',\n"
"	'p4 -I fetch', 'p4 -I push', 'p4 -I zip', and 'p4 -I unzip'.\n"
"	This flag is not compatible with the -s, -e, -G options.\n"
"\n"
"	The -L flag specifies the language for text messages from the\n"
"	server, overriding the value of $P4LANGUAGE in the environment.\n"
"	Setting this option only works if the administrator has loaded\n"
"	support for non-English messages into the server database.\n"
"\n"
"	The -p flag specifies the server's listen address, overriding the\n"
"	value of $P4PORT in the environment and the default (perforce:1666).\n"
"\n"
"	The -P flag specifies the password, overriding the value of\n"
"	$P4PASSWD in the environment.\n"
"\n"
"	The -q flag suppresses all info messages.\n"
"\n"
"	The -Q flag specifies the client's command character set,\n"
"	overriding the value of $P4COMMANDCHARSET in the environment.\n"
"	See 'p4 help charset' for more information.\n"
"\n"
"	The -r flag specifies the number of times a sync command should be\n"
"	retried if the network times out (takes longer than N seconds to\n"
"	respond to a single I/O operation) during sync command execution.\n"
"	For example:\n"
"           p4 -r4 -vnet.maxwait=300 sync //...\n"
"	specifies to retry this 'sync' up to 4 times, should any single\n"
"	network operation take longer than 5 minutes to complete. The -r\n"
"	flag should not be used on a command which reads from stdin.\n"
"\n"
"	The -s flag causes the p4 command line client program to prefix\n"
"	each line of output with a tag (error, warning, info, text, exit)\n"
"	to make it easier to use for scripting.\n"
"\n"
"	The -u flag specifies the user name, overriding the value of\n"
"	$P4USER, $USER, and $USERNAME in the environment.\n"
"\n"
"	The -x flag instructs p4 to read arguments, one per line, from the\n"
"	specified file.  If you specify '-', standard input is read.\n"
"\n"
"	The -V flag displays the version of the p4 client command and exits.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"    p4 admin dump\n"
"	Outputs a checkpoint of the server through the client.  Important:\n"
"	read-locks the database during the entire operation!  Normally\n"
"	database locks are not held during network I/O to the client.\n"
"	This command requires 'super' access.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 admin import [-l] [-b batchsz] [-f]\n"
"	Imports a journal of the server through the client.  The journal\n"
"	data is read from the standard input.  When the data has been\n"
"	transfered to the server, it is processed in batches with the\n"
"	batch size of 5000 records or the number specified with the '-b'\n"
"	flag.  Each batch locks only the tables that will change.\n"
"	The -l flag instructs import to write-lock all database tables\n"
"	and processes all data until it comes to the end of the file or\n"
"	encounters an error.  When applying records to the database, it\n"
"	ignores failures to delete records,  unlike 'p4d -jr', which\n"
"	normally terminates if it can't delete a record as indicated by\n"
"	the journal.  Avoid using this command to import large journal\n"
"	files, because the entire file has to fit in memory.\n"
"	The -f flag forces a replica server to run this command.\n"
"	This command requires 'super' access.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 branch -F stream [ -P parent ] -o name\n"
"	The -F flag used with -o will output the full branch spec generated\n"
"	using the named stream view that includes imported paths. The\n"
"	optional -P option allows a user to specify a different parent\n"
"	stream for the branch source.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 client -of\n"
"	An administrator may combine the -o and -f flags in order to display\n"
"	information about the client view havemaps. Havemaps are created when\n"
"	a client view is modified.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 clone -A\n"
"	The -A flag excludes archive content for the new revisions. This flag\n"
"	also prevents the automatic sync normally performed by clone.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 configure show env\n"
"	Displays the command-line flags and environment variables that were\n"
"	in effect when this server was started.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 configure show undoc\n"
"	Displays a list of all the server tunable parameters and their\n"
"	current values. Consult Perforce Technical Support before\n"
"	changing values.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 copy -e\n"
"	Only existing source files are considered for copying to the target.\n"
"	Target files with no corresponding source files are ignored.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 cstat\n"
"	Dump change/sync status for current client.\n"
"	See 'p4 help cstat'.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 dbpack\n"
"	Reorder database index pages.\n"
"	See 'p4 help dbpack'\n"
"\n"
"    p4 diff2 -F stream [-P parent] [[file1] file2]\n"
"	The -F flag causes diff2 to use the full stream branch, including\n"
"	imported paths, to determine the pairs of files to compare. The files\n"
"	are compared against the parent stream. The optional -P flag allows\n"
"	a user to specify a different parent stream to diff against. If file\n"
"	arguments are also present, they can further limit the files and\n"
"	specify the revisions for comparison.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 diff/diff2/describe -dh\n"
"	The -dh compares files on a word-by-word basis (using whitespace\n"
"	as a separator rather than just newline), and marks differences\n"
"	with HTML tags that switch the font to red or blue for words that\n"
"	are only in the first or second file, respectively.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 diff/diff2/describe -dv\n"
"	The -dv compares files on a word-by-word basis (using character\n"
"	classes rather than just newline), and marks differences with\n"
"	HTML tags that switch the font to red or blue for words only\n"
"	in the first or second file, respectively.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 discover\n"
"	This variant of 'p4 info' is used to discover if a server is\n"
"	in unicode mode or not.  It's important to allow this through\n"
"	a broker.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 duplicate\n"
"	Duplicate revisions and their integration history.\n"
"	See 'p4 help duplicate'.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 edit/delete -L [file ...] \n"
"	The -L flag can be used with multiple file arguments in order to\n"
"	process them altogether.  This flag can help performance when dealing\n"
"	with many +l files and issuing the command from an edge server.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 fetch [-p target -A -I -u]\n"
"	The -p flag specifies the address of the target server, overriding\n"
"	the address from the remote spec specified by the -r flag.\n"
"\n"
"	The -I flag excludes integration records for the new revisions.\n"
"\n"
"	The -A flag excludes archive content for the new revisions. This flag\n"
"	also prevents the automatic sync normally performed by fetch.\n"
"\n"
"	The -u flag specifies that conflicting changes should be unsubmitted,\n"
"	not relocated to a tangent. The -u flag requires the -r flag, and\n"
"	also requires that an administrator has set server.allowrewrite=1.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 filelog -1\n"
"	This flag prevents filelog from following any renames resulting from\n"
"	use of the 'p4 move' command. By default, filelog follows moved files.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 fstat [-OcChiz]\n"
"	The -Oc flag outputs the path, revision and type of the server\n"
"	archive file (requires 'admin' privilege). The -OC flag is the same\n"
"	as -Oc, but includes archived revisions. The -Oz flag outputs the\n"
"	path and revision of any lazy copies (requires 'admin' privilege).\n"
"	The -Oh flag outputs the size, digest and any selected attributes of\n"
"	the synced revision rather than the head revision. The -Oi flag\n"
"	outputs extra (debugging) information about the attributes.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 help commandments\n"

"\n"
"    p4 integrate -1 -2 -C changelist# -Rlo -Znnn\n"
"	The flag '-1' can be supplied to the 'p4 integrate' command to\n"
"	force consideration of direct integration history only.  The -C\n"
"	changelist# flag considers only	integration history from changelists\n"
"	at or below the given number, allowing you to ignore credit from\n"
"	subsequent integrations.  The -2 flag uses the old 'second generation'\n"
"	integrate engine (2006.1).  The -Rl flag causes only edited revisions\n"
"	to require integration.  The -Ro flag suppresses the scheduling of\n"
"	non-content resolves.  The -Z flag overrides the dm.integ.tweaks\n"
"	configurable setting.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 integrate -Dst -d -i -I -o -t -v\n"
"	These flags are deprecated but preserved for backward compatibility.\n"
"		-Dt     If the target file has been deleted and the source\n"
"			file has changed, re-branch the source file on top\n"
"			of the target file instead of scheduling a resolve.\n"
"		-Ds     If the source file has been deleted and the target\n"
"			file has changed, delete the target file instead of\n"
"			scheduling a resolve.\n"
"		-d	Synonym for '-Dist'.\n"
"		-i/-I	Use the first revision of the source as the base for\n"
"			baseless merges, rather than an empty file.\n"
"		-o	Synonym for '-Ob'.\n"
"		-t	Force filetype and attributes to be copied from the\n"
"			source file rather than scheduling resolves.\n"
"		-v	Open files virtually when no resolve is scheduled.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 jobspec presets\n"
"	Preset values for job non-optional fields that undergo variable\n"
"	expansion, in addition to the simple $now, $blank, and $user\n"
"	substitution.  The variables supported include: %%old%% (previous\n"
"	contents of field), %%action%% (what caused the update of the form),\n"
"	%%n%% (a newline), %%date%% (date and time), %%day%% (date only),\n"
"	and %%user%%.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 jobspec codes over 10000\n"
"	Jobspec field codes are required to be in the range 100-199 or over\n"
"	10000.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 merge3\n"
"	Three-way file merge.\n"
"	See 'p4 help merge3'.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 obliterate [ -iI ]\n"
"	Tells obliterate to synthesize new integration records to attempt\n"
"	to bridge the gaps left by the obliteration of intermediate branches.\n"
"	If '-i' is used, only the initial branch records are considered; if\n"
"	'-I' is used, all records are considered.  Note that it is possible\n"
"	to end up with more integration records than you started with.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 pull -I\n"
"	The '-I' flag specifies the pull interval in milliseconds.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 push [-p target -I]\n"
"	The -p flag specifies the address of the target server, overriding\n"
"	the address from the remote spec specified by the -r flag.\n"
"\n"
"	The -I flag excludes integration records for the new revisions.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 resolve -dg\n"
"	The'-dg' flag makes the default merge algorithm more guarded about\n"
"	merging adjacent chunks.  When this option is specified, \n"
"	more conflicts are returned,  especially where changes in both \n"
"	'yours' and 'theirs' are identical but then diverge.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 resolve -e\n"
"	Translates all 'ignored' results to 'edit from', leaving the contents\n"
"	unchanged.  The resulting revision is a candidate for integration back\n"
"	to its source, which has the effect of undoing the 'ignored' change.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 retype\n"
"	Change revision or server archive type.\n"
"	See 'p4 help retype'.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 search\n"

"    p4 spec\n"
"	Edit spec definitions.\n"
"	See 'p4 help spec'.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 submit -c <change> --forcenoretransfer\n"
"	This option instructs submit to bypass the client file transfer if\n"
"	the archive is found to be already present on the server. If the\n"
"	archive is found, submit will bypass the client file transfer and\n"
"	commit the archive content even if it differs from the client file\n"
"	content. This option is only allowed if the undocumented tunable\n"
"	value 'submit.forcenoretransfer' is set to 1 or higher. If the\n"
"	tunable is set to 2, 'submit -c N' defaults to --forcenoretransfer.\n"
"	Files submitted without a file transfer are recorded with no digest\n"
"	value; you may set the digest later if desired, for example by\n"
"	running verify or by other means. NOTE: bypassing file transfer\n"
"	is a very advanced feature requiring specific workflows to be\n"
"	used and with specific restrictions to its operation.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 submit -t\n"
"	Tamper-checks branch/sync files and files resolved with 'at' \n"
"	(copy from/lazy-copied files). This check can significantly slow submit.\n"
"	Imported files are never tamper-checked.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 -ztzoffset=N verify\n"
"	Operating a replica in a timezone other than the master's timezone\n"
"	can cause files of type +k which use $Date$ or $DateTime$ keywords\n"
"	to verify as BAD! Specify the master's timezone offset to cause the\n"
"	replica to use that timezone for keyed file verification. This value\n"
"	does not, however, affect the time zone name shown by $DateTimeTZ$.\n"
"\n"
"    Predefined Trigger Actions\n"
"	The predefined trigger actions 'pass' and 'fail' are processed\n"
"	by the server without calling any external scripts. 'pass' will\n"
"	always succeed. 'fail' will always fail and return the expanded\n"
"	argument list as the error message.\n"
"\n"
"    Relative revisions @<, @<=, @>, @>=, @=\n"
"	            and #<, #<=, #>, #>=, #=\n"
"	Anywhere a revision range can be specified, the revisions can be\n"
"	modified with relative operators.  Relative operators on #head\n"
"	(other than = and <=) aren't supported.  A maximum of 4 revision\n"
"	specifications (separated by ,s) are allowed: the implied operator\n"
"	on the first is >=; thereafter <=.  You must quote < and > for the\n"
"	command-line shell.  See 'p4 help revisions' for a description of\n"
"	revision specifications.\n"
"\n"
"    Revision actions #add, #edit, #delete, #branch, #integrate, #import\n"
"	Selects all revisions with the specified action.  Actions are not\n"
"	relative, which means that #action cannot be used in a revision range.\n"
"	For many commands, when multiple revisions of the same\n"
"	file are selected, the highest revision is used.\n"
"\n"
"    FileType modifier +T\n"
"	The +T modifier stores the revisions in the server in a database\n"
"	file called tiny.db, which is useful for lots of very small\n"
"	files.  The types ttext and tbinary are equivalent to text+T and\n"
"	binary+T.  tiny.db is not backed up with a normal checkpoint.\n"
"	Backups are done via 'p4d -xf 857 > tiny.ckp' and restores with\n"
"	'p4d -xf 857 tiny.ckp'\n"
"\n"
"    Versioned character set\n"
"	Set the server.filecharset configurable to 1 in order to version\n"
"	the charset of individual unicode files along with the filetype.\n"
"	With this configurable enabled, each unicode file has a charset\n"
"	associated with it that will be used instead of the local P4CHARSET\n"
"	when reading and writing the file in the client workspace.  This\n"
"	versioned charset is set to the local P4CHARSET on add by default\n"
"	and may be changed explicitly by using the -Q flag on add, edit, and\n"
"	reopen.  The 'p4 reopen -X -Q charset' command will convert the client\n"
"	file's contents into the new charset; otherwise it is assumed that the\n"
"	client file already matches the newly specified charset.  Note that\n"
"	this feature requires client-side support; if not all client\n"
"	applications in use support this feature, confusing behavior may\n"
"	result.\n"
"\n"
"    Jobspec format\n"
"	The 'p4 jobspec' form can have an additional field 'Formats:' to\n"
"	help Perforce visual clients display forms properly.  Each row\n"
"	of the Format field consists of three words: field, order, and format.\n"
"	The order is an integer (starting at 1) indicating the display order\n"
"	(the display order is otherwise undefined). \n"
"	The format is: normal, L, R, or I; for full line, left half, \n"
"	right half, indented.  If a right field follows a left, they\n"
"	are displayed on the same line.\n"
"\n"
"    JobStatus field on 'p4 change', 'p4 submit'\n"
"	'p4 change' and 'p4 submit' forms have a 'JobStatus' field that is not\n"
"	normally displayed.  This field sets the fix status for all jobs,\n"
"	overriding the default (which is 'closed').  A job's fix status can be\n"
"	set using the 'p4 change -s' and 'p4 submit -s' commands.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 -zmaxLockTime=n command\n"
"    p4 -zmaxOpenFiles=n command\n"
"    p4 -zmaxResults=n command\n"
"    p4 -zmaxScanRows=n command\n"
"	Overrides the user's maxLockTime/maxOpenFiles/maxResults/maxScanRows\n"
"	for the command. Note that the server.commandlimits configurable\n"
"	affects the operation of these command-level overrides.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 -e\n"
"	Extended version of the '-s' output that displays more detailed\n"
"	information about each error/info message received, including the\n"
"	formatting strings, unique error codes, and severity values that\n"
"	are available to API users.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 -E P4VAR=value\n"
"	Override the value of an arbitrary environment/config variable,\n"
"	as in a P4CONFIG file.  Multiple instances of this flag can be used.\n"
"	Useful for variables without dedicated override flags (such as P4DIFF).\n"
"\n"
"    p4 -F formatstring\n"
"	Override the formatting string of server messages, allowing output\n"
"	to be customized for easier scripting.  Use the '-e' global option\n"
"	to see examples of built-in message strings and the dictionary of\n"
"	variables associated with each message.  The '-F' option also works\n"
"	with the dictionary provided by tagged (-Ztag) output mode.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 --field Field=replacement_text\n"
"    p4 --field Field+=extra_text\n"
"	Modify the contents of a spec returned by p4 [specname] -o.  The\n"
"	modified spec can be piped directly to another command that expects\n"
"	a formatted spec, e.g. p4 [specname] -i.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 -R\n"
"	Formats all output (and batch input for form commands with -i)\n"
"	as marshalled Ruby hash objects.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 -x cmdfile run\n"
"	Runs the commands listed in cmdfile one after the next, using a\n"
"	single connection to the server.\n"
"\n"
"    p4 unsubmit -c N\n"
"	Unsubmits the specified changelist by changelist number. Each\n"
"	changelist is unsubmitted independently, but if you specify\n"
"	multiple interdependent changelists, you must specify them in\n"
"	descending changelist order.\n"
"\n"
"    p4d -Cn\n"
"	Forces the server to operate in case-sensitive mode (n=0) on Windows\n"
"	or case-insensitive mode (n=1) on Unix.  n=2 is an experimental\n"
"	'hybrid' order that folds case while preserving uniqueness. Changing\n"
"	Attempting to change modes after a database is created produces an\n"
"	error.\n"
"\n"
"    p4d -jds dumpfile\n"
"	Dumps the server metadata to the specified file. Unlike p4d -jd,\n"
"	ignores the table indexes and reads in file system order rather than\n"
"	data order.  This option can be useful for recovery if the btree\n"
"	index structure becomes corrupt.  This recovery procedure is not\n"
"	meant for normal production operation.  Restoring the resulting\n"
"	dump file does not compact the btrees as effectively as restoring\n"
"	from regular checkpoints does, and such restores take longer to\n"
"	complete.\n"
"\n"
"    p4d -n\n"
"       Starts the server in maintenance mode. Maintenance mode does not\n"
"       police the user and file count restrictions listed in the license\n"
"       file. When in maintenance mode a server is only able to perform\n"
"       those commands that do not require a client. In addition, if the\n"
"       server is in maintenance mode and it is a member of a DCS cluster\n"
"       it will not launch a p4zk process.\n"
"\n"
"    p4d -xf bugno\n"
"	Updates the server data to fix problems due to the\n"
"	specified bug number.  Valid values of bugno are as follows:\n"
"\n"
 "		857 -- checkpoint/restore tiny.db\n"
"		925 -- working and locks table out of sync\n"
"		3104 -- early 99.2 resolve bug\n"
"		4164 -- early 2000.1 submit bug\n"
"		12904 -- replace / with _ in client names\n"
"		18362 -- 2005.2 replace 'check' trigger command\n"
"		43361 -- 2012.2 - recreate db.have from db.working\n"
"		71819 -- 2013.2 - clears unneeded/invalid charset data\n"
"		71917 -- 2014.2 - promoted shelved changes on commit server\n"
"\n"
"    p4d -xU upgrade\n"
"	Re-runs the named upgrade step that is normally done automatically by\n"
"	p4d -xu.  To display a list of steps, issue the 'p4d -xU help' command.\n"
"	This option can be used to rebuild certain tables (like db.archmap).\n"
"\n"
"    p4d -xx [-q -o output] [table1 [table2]]\n"
"	Checks consistency between table pairs, producing a file\n"
"	jnl.fix with '@dv@' and '@pv@' records which, when read in with\n"
"	p4d -jr, eliminate any inconsistencies.  If table names are\n"
"	specified, only those tables are checked.  Check the jnl.fix file\n"
"	for accuracy before attempting any updates. Use the -o flag to specify\n"
"	a filename other than jnl.fix. Specify -q to print output messages\n"
"	only if inconsistencies are found.\n"
"\n"
"    p4d -xr\n"
"	Does a low-level verification and repair of database files. \n"
"	Use only as a last resort if checkpoint and journal are not\n"
"	available.\n"
"\n"
"    p4d -xrU\n"
"	Resets the UnlockCount of database files, but makes no other repairs.\n"
"	Use only as a last resort if checkpoint and journal are not\n"
"	available.\n"
"\n"
"    p4d -p <serverlevel> -jd\n"
"	The -p flag directs the server to dump metadata in a form compatible\n"
"	with an older server version.  The earliest version that might work\n"
"	is 2005.1, which is server level 19.\n"
"\n"
"    p4d -m rcsfiles...  \n"
"	Dumps RCS metadata from files to a format suitable for the\n"
"	CVS-to-Perforce conversion script.\n"
"\n"
"    p4d -M readonly [options]\n"
"	The -M readonly option, used only with replica servers, directs\n"
"	the replica server to only accept readonly metadata commands.\n"
"	This overrides the db.replication configurable.\n"
"\n"
"    p4d -D readonly|shared|ondemand|cache|none [options]\n"
"	The -D flag is used only with replica servers to specify the\n"
"	approach for handling depot file content. A replica running\n"
"	with '-D readonly' automatically transfers copies of the target\n"
"	server's files. A replica running with '-D shared' or '-D ondemand'\n"
"	either shares the same physical archives as the target or uses\n"
"	external archive synchronization from the target. A replica running\n"
"	with '-D cache' only requests file transfer as needed by user\n"
"	commands. A replica running with '-D none' rejects any command that\n"
"	requires access to depot files. This overrides the lbr.replication\n"
"	configurable.\n"
"\n"
"    p4p -k ...\n"
"	Start the Perforce Proxy without cache timestamp checking.\n"
"	The Perforce Proxy normally uses a timestamp on cached revisions\n"
"	to check that the right revision is delivered if an obliterate\n"
"	deletes a revision that is subsequently replaced with an identically-\n"
"	numbered revision.  Using this option causes problems if head\n"
"	revisions are obliterated.  However, the proxy cache can be pre-\n"
"	loaded with the server's archive files by specifying this flag\n"
"	when you start the proxy.\n"
"\n"
"    p4p -w ...\n"
"	Start the Perforce Proxy in read-only cache mode.  In this mode\n"
"	the proxy never updates its cache, which is useful if the cache\n"
"	is updated through a WAN NFS or other system-level remote\n"
"	filesystem method.\n"
"\n"
"    P4AUTH=central-server-address\n"
"	P4AUTH functionality is now fully supported for 2010.2, see the\n"
"	System Administration Guide for more details.\n"
"\n"
"    P4CHANGE=central-server-address\n"
"	P4CHANGE functionality is now fully supported for 2010.2, see the\n"
"	System Administration Guide for more details.\n"
"\n"
"    P4LOG=syslog\n"
"	Uses syslog instead of the named error log file for server error\n"
"	logging.  Must be set in server's environment.\n"
"\n"
"    P4DEBUG=server=2\n"
"	Logs server commands to the file configured by P4LOG.  The server=2\n"
"	option logs command completion. Must be set in server's environment.\n"
"	To disable all command logging, set server=0.\n"
"\n"
"    Perforce server configurables (unsupported)\n"

"	For information about supported server configuration variables, see\n"

"    Introduction to streams\n"
"\n"
"	A Perforce 'stream' is (generally) a branch of files.  Each stream\n"
"	has a parent stream and any number of child streams.  The backbone\n"
"	of a stream system is the mainline, a stream with no parent.\n"
"\n"
"	A stream typically contains files that are branched from its parent\n"
"	stream. Work on files occurs in the context of a stream. As files are\n"
"	modified, changes can be integrated (i.e., merged or copied) between\n"
"	the stream and its parent.\n"
"\n"
"	A child stream is either a 'development', 'release', 'task' or a\n"
"	'virtual' stream.  On a scale of stability, a development stream\n"
"	is considered lower than its parent, while a release stream is\n" 
"	considered higher than its parent.  Change is expected to flow down\n"
"	by merging, and up by copying.  This \"merge down, copy up\" practice\n"
"	assures that merging is done only when necessary, and always in the\n"
"	more forgiving of the two streams involved.\n"
"\n"
"	A stream is identified by its unique depot location.  A 'spec' defines\n"
"	the stream's location, its type, its parent stream, the files in its\n"
"	view, and other configurable behaviors.  A stream can be reparented\n"
"	by changing its spec.\n"
"\n"
"	A stream's 'view' refers to both the client view and the branch view\n"
"	that are generated from the spec.  Generated client views are inserted\n"
"	automatically when a user creates a stream client.  Generated branch\n"
"	views are used automatically by commands that compare or integrate \n"
"	files.\n"
"	\n"
"	The stream view enables you to specify which files can be submitted\n"
"	to the stream and merged or copied from its parent stream.  A parent\n"
"	stream controls the scope of a child stream's view.  The stream view\n"
"	is inherited from the parent stream (except for mainline streams,\n"
"	which have no parent).  You can refine the view of a child stream to\n"
"	make it more restrictive than its parent, but you cannot change the\n"
"	view to make it less restrictive than the view of the parent.\n"
"	Virtual streams can be used to create alternative views of real\n"
"	streams.\n"
"\n"
"	Virtual streams differ from other stream types in that a virtual\n"
"	stream is not a branch of files, but instead a filtered view of \n"
"	its parent stream. A virtual stream can have child streams, and its\n"
"	child streams inherit its views.\n"
"\n"
"	Task streams are lightweight short-lived branches that are great for\n"
"	bug fixing or new features that only modify a small subset of the\n"
"	branch data. Since branched (copied) files are tracked in a set of\n"
"	shadow tables which are later removed, repository metadata is kept\n"
"	to a minimum when using this type of stream.  Note: only a client\n"
"	of the task stream will see the branched data, only modified data\n"
"	that is promoted becomes visible to users with access to the stream\n"
"	namespace.\n"
"\n"

"	users who have AuthMethod set to 'ldap'. In addition to the host and\n"
"	port of the LDAP server, this configuration defines how the\n"
"	authenticationshould happen, by picking one of three bind methods:\n"
"\n"
"	Simple:\n"
"	This authentication method takes a template DN and substitutes %%user%%\n"
"	placeholders with the user's userId to produce the user's DN which the\n"
"	Perforce Server will then attempt to bind against, validating the\n"
"	user's password. An example of such a template could look like this:\n"
"\n"
"	    uid=%%user%%,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org\n"
"\n"
"	Search:\n"
"	This authentication method uses an LDAP search query to locate the\n"
"	appropriate user record. It requires a known base DN for the search\n"
"	and an LDAP search query (which should make use of the %%user%%\n"
"	placeholder). It may also require the full DN and password of a known\n"
"	read-only entity in the directory in order to perform the search.\n"
"	An example base DN and LDAP query might look like this:\n"
"\n"
"	    Base DN: ou=users,dc=example,dc=org\n"
"	    LDAP query: (uid=%%user%%)\n"
"\n"
"	SASL:\n"
"	This authentication method defers the user search to the LDAP server\n"
"	and does not require a DN to be discovered before a bind is attempted.\n"
"	A specific realm may be provided if the LDAP server has multiple\n"
"	realms (or domains in the case of Active Directory). Additionally, if\n"
"	'realminusername' option is enabled, the realm will be separated from\n"
"	the useranme if that username is in either UNC (realm\\user) or\n"
"	UPN (user@realm) formats.\n"
"\n"
"	SASL is generally the easiest method to configure if the LDAP server\n"
"	supports SASL DIGEST-MD5.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"	To enable LDAP authentication, one or more LDAP configurations must\n"
"	exist and be assigned a priority with the 'auth.ldap.order.N'\n"
"	configurable. The server will need to be restarted before LDAP\n"
"	authentication will be enabled. Note: LDAP authentication implies at\n"
"	least security level 3; all must use ticket based authentication (see\n"
"	'p4 login') and any users authenticating against the Perforce database\n"
"	must have strong passwords.\n"
"\n"
"	If more than one 'auth.ldap.order.N' configurable is set to a valid\n"
"	configuration, each one is considered enabled and a login by a user\n"
"	with AuthMethod set to ldap will cause each enabled configuration\n"
"	to be checked in order until the user's credentials are validated or\n"
"	the user record is found but the credentials are rejected.\n"
"\n"
"	When LDAP authentication is enabled and the 'auth.default.method'\n"
"	configurable is set to 'ldap' and the 'auth.ldap.userautocreate'\n"
"	configureable is set to 1, any user who is able to authenticate will be\n"
"	created and will consume a license, regardless of whether they are\n"
"	granted access by 'p4 protect'. If the 'getattrs' option is enabled,\n"
"	the new user's Fullname and Email fields will be populated from the\n"
"	user's record in the directory using the values in the LDAP attributes\n"
"	specified in the 'AttributeName' and 'AttributeEmail' fields. If the\n"
"	'BindMethod' is 'SASL', this feature also requires the 'SearchBaseDN'\n"
"	and 'SearchFilter' fields to be configured.\n"
"\n"
"	In addition to the bind methods, user access can be restricted only to\n"
"	those who belong to a particular group within the directory. This is\n"
"	achieved by performing an LDAP search as the user who has just been\n"
"	authenticated, and checking that there is at least one record returned\n"
"	from that search. This search requires a base DN and a LDAP query that\n"
"	contains the %%user%% placeholder. An example base DN and LDAP query to\n"
"	check that the user is in a group named 'perforce' might look like:\n"
"\n"
"	    Base DN: ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org\n"
"	    LDAP query: (&(cn=perforce)(memberUid=%%user%%))\n"
"\n"
"\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"	Obliterate is aware of lazy copies made when 'p4 integrate' creates\n"

"	files in the archive will be removed.\n"
"\n"
"	If the file argument has a revision, the specified revision is\n"
"	obliterated.  If the file argument has a revision range, the\n"
"	revisions in that range are obliterated.  See 'p4 help revisions'\n"
"	for help.\n"
"\n"
"	By default, obliterate displays a preview of the results. To execute\n"
"	the operation, you must specify the -y flag.\n"
"\n"
"	Obliterate has three flags that can improve performance (-b, -a, -h):\n"
"\n"
"	The '-b' flag restricts files in the argument range to those that\n"
"	are branched and are both the first revision and the head revision\n"
"	This flag is useful for removing old branches while keeping files\n"
"	of interest (files that were modified).\n"
"\n"
"	The '-a' flag skips the archive search and removal phase.  This\n"
"	phase of obliterate can take a very long time for sites with big\n"
"	archive maps (db.archmap).  However, file content is not removed;\n"
"	if the file was a branch, then it's most likely that the archival\n"
"	search is not necessary.  This option is safe to use with the '-b'\n"
"	option.\n"
"\n"
"	The '-h' flag instructs obliterate not to search db.have for all\n"
"	possible matching records to delete.  Usually, db.have is one of the\n"
"	largest tables in a repository and consequently this search takes\n"
"	a long time.  Do not use this flag when obliterating branches or\n"
"	namespaces for reuse,  because the old content on any client\n"
"	will not match the newly-added repository files.  Note that use of\n"
"	the -h flag has the side-effect of cleaning the obliterated files\n"
"	from client workspaces when they are synced.\n"
"\n"
"	When a revision has been archived, its action is changed to archive.\n"
"	By default, obliterate will not process a revision which has been\n"
"	archived. To include such revisions, you must specify the -A flag.\n"
"	Note that obliterate -A does not affect the metadata and content in\n"
"	the archive depot. To remove the metadata and content in the archive\n"
"	depot, see 'p4 help archive' and the corresponding '-p' flag. Note\n"
"	also that obliterating an archive revision with the -A flag means\n"
"	you can no longer restore it nor use 'archive -p', so typically you\n"
"	should use 'archive -p' instead of 'obliterate -A'.\n"
"\n"
"	If you are obliterating files in order to entirely remove a depot\n"
"	from the server, and files in that depot have been integrated to\n"
"	other depots, run 'p4 snap' first to break those linkages, so that\n"
"	obliterate can remove the unreferenced archive files. If, instead,\n"
"	you specify '-a' to skip the archive removal phase, then you will\n"
"	need to specify '-f' when deleting the depot, since the presence\n"

"\n"
"	Resolving involves two sets of files, a source and a target.  The\n"

"	   Attribute:   The target's attributes are replaced.\n"
" 	   Branching:	A new target is branched.\n"

"	Triggers are administrator-defined commands that the server runs\n"
"	to perform the following:\n"
"\n"
"	Validate changelist submissions.\n"
"\n"
"	    The server runs changelist triggers before the file transfer,\n"
"	    between file transfer and changelist commit, upon commit failure,\n"
"	    or after the commit.\n"
"\n"
"	Validate shelve operations.\n"
"\n"
"	    The server runs shelve triggers before files are shelved, after\n"
"	    files are shelved, or when shelved files have been discarded\n"
"	    (via shelve -d).\n"
"\n"
"	Manipulate and validate forms.\n"
"\n"
"	    The server runs form-validating triggers between generating\n"
"	    and outputting the form, between inputting and parsing the\n"
"	    form, between parsing and saving the form, or when deleting\n"
"	    the form.\n"
"\n"
"	Authenticate or change a user password.\n"
"\n"
"	    The server runs authentication triggers to either validate\n"
"	    a user password during login or when setting a new password.\n"
"\n"
"	Intercept job fix additions or deletions.\n"
"\n"
"	    The server run fix triggers prior to adding or deleting a fix\n"
"	    between a job and changelist.\n"
"\n"
"	Access external archive files.\n"
"\n"
"	    For files with the +X filetype modifier, the server runs an\n"
"	    archive trigger to read, write, or delete files in the archive.\n"
"\n"
"	Command execution policy.\n"
"\n"
"	    Command triggers can be specified to run before and after\n"
"	    processing of user requests.  Pre-execution triggers can\n"
"	    prevent the command from running.\n"
"\n"
"	Server maintenance.\n"
"\n"
"	    Journal rotation triggers can be specified to run after the\n"
"	    journals have rotated to the target server. These will only run\n"
"	    when the journal rotation is triggered by 'p4 admin journal',\n"
"	    'p4 admin checkpoint' or on replicas when they rotate to match\n"
"	    the master.\n"
"\n"
"	The trigger form has a single entry 'Triggers:', followed by any\n"
"	number of trigger lines.  Each trigger line must be indented with\n"
"	spaces or tabs in the form. Triggers are executed in the order listed\n"
"	and if a trigger fails, subsequent triggers are not run.  A trigger\n"
"	succeeds if the executed command exits returning 0 and fails otherwise.\n"
"	Normally the failure of a trigger prevents the operation from\n"
"	completing, except for the commit and journal triggers, which run after\n"
"	the operation is complete, or the change-failed trigger which is only\n"
"	advisory.\n"
"\n"
"	Each trigger line contains a trigger name, a trigger type, a depot\n"
"	file path pattern matching where the trigger will be executed, a\n"
"	command name or form type and a command to run.\n"
"\n"
"	Name:   The name of the trigger.  For change triggers, a run of the\n"
"		same trigger name on contiguous lines is treated as a single\n"
"		trigger so that multiple paths can be specified.  Only the\n"
"		command of the first such trigger line is used.\n"
"\n"
"	Type:	When the trigger is to execute:\n"
"\n"
"		archive:\n"
"		    Execute an archive trigger for the server to access\n"
"		    any file with the +X filetype modifier.\n"
"\n"
"		auth-check:\n"
"		service-check:\n"
"		    Execute an authentication check trigger to verify a\n"
"		    user's password against an external password manager\n"
"		    during login or when setting a new password.\n"
"\n"
"		auth-check-sso:\n"
"		    Facilitate a single sign-on user authentication. This\n"
"		    configuration requires two programs or scripts to run;\n"
"		    one on the client, the other on the server.\n"
"\n"
"		    client:\n"
"		        Set the environment variable 'P4LOGINSSO' to point to\n"
"		        a script that can be executed to obtain the user's\n"
"		        credentials or other information that the server\n"
"		        trigger can verify.  The client-side script must\n"
"		        write the message to the standard output\n"
"		        (max length 128K).\n"
"\n"
"		        Example:  P4LOGINSSO=/Users/joe/bin/runsso\n"
"\n"
"		        The two variables available to this trigger are\n"
"		        %%P4PORT%% and %%serverAddress%%.  The distinction is\n"
"		        that serverAddress is the address of the target server\n"
"		        and the P4PORT is what the client is connecting to,\n"
"		        which might be an intermediate like a Perforce Proxy.\n"
"\n"
"		        These variables can be passed to the client script by\n"
"		        appending them to the client command string, as in:\n"
"\n"
"		        P4LOGINSSO=\"/Users/joe/bin/runsso %%serverAddress%%\"\n"
"\n"
"		    server:\n"
"		        Execute an authentication (sso) trigger that gets\n"
"		        this message from the standard input and returns an\n"
"		        exit status of 0 (for verified) or otherwise failed.\n"
"\n"
"		        Example:\n"
"		            sso auth-check-sso auth \"/secure/verify %%user%%\"\n"
"\n"
"		    The user must issue the 'p4 login' command, but no\n"
"		    password prompting is invoked.  If the server\n"
"		    determines that the user is valid, they are issued a\n"
"		    Perforce ticket just as if they had logged in with a\n"
"		    password.\n"
"\n"
"		    Pre-2007.2 clients cannot run a client-side single\n"
"		    sign-on.  Specifying an 'auth-check' trigger as a backup\n"
"		    for a user to gain access will prompt the user for a\n"
"		    password if it's an older client or P4LOGINSSO has not\n"
"		    been configured.\n"
"\n"
"		    Unlike passwords which are encrypted, the sso message is\n"
"		    sent to the server in clear text.\n"
"\n"
"		auth-set:\n"
"		    Execute an authentication set trigger to send a new\n"
"		    password to an external password manager.\n"
"\n"
"		change-submit:\n"
"		    Execute pre-submit trigger after changelist has been\n"
"		    created and files locked but prior to file transfer.\n"
"\n"
"		change-content:\n"
"		    Execute mid-submit trigger after file transfer but prior\n"
"		    to commit.  Files can be accessed by the 'p4 diff2',\n"
"		    'p4 files', 'p4 fstat', and 'p4 print' commands using\n"
"		    the revision specification '@=change', where 'change' is\n"
"		    the pending changelist number passed as %%changelist%%.\n"
"\n"
"		change-commit:\n"
"		    Execute post-submit trigger after changelist commit.\n"
"\n"
"		change-failed:\n"
"		    Executes only if the changelist commit failed.\n"
"		    Note that this trigger only fires on errors\n"
"		    occurring after a commit process has started. It does\n"
"		    not fire for early usage errors, or due to errors from\n"
"		    the submit form. In short, if a change-* trigger\n"
"		    could have run, then the change-failed trigger\n"
"		    will fire if that commit fails.\n"
"\n"
"		command:\n"
"		    Execute pre/post trigger when users run commands.\n"
"\n"
"		edge-submit:\n"
"		    Execute pre-submit trigger on Edge Server after changelist\n"
"		    has been created but prior to file transfer.\n"
"\n"
"		edge-content:\n"
"		    Execute mid-submit trigger on Edge Server after file\n"
"		    transfer but prior to beginning submit on Commit Server.\n"
"\n"
"		fix-add:\n"
"		    Execute fix trigger prior to adding a fix.  The special\n"
"		    variable %%jobs%% is available for expansion and must be\n"
"		    the last argument to the trigger as it expands to one\n"
"		    argument for each job listed on the 'p4 fix' command.\n"
"\n"
"		fix-delete:\n"
"		    Execute fix trigger prior to deleting a fix.  The special\n"
"		    variable %%jobs%% is available for expansion and must be\n"
"		    the last argument to the trigger as it expands to one\n"
"		    argument for each job listed on the 'p4 fix -d' command.\n"
"\n"
"		form-out:\n"
"		    Execute form trigger on generation of form.	 Trigger may\n"
"		    modify form.\n"
"\n"
"		form-in:\n"
"		    Execute form trigger on input of form before its contents\n"
"		    are parsed and validated.  Trigger may modify form.\n"
"\n"
"		form-save:\n"
"		    Execute form trigger prior to save of form after its\n"
"		    contents are parsed.\n"
"\n"
"		form-commit:\n"
"		    Execute form trigger after it has been committed, allowing\n"
"		    access to automatically generated fields (jobname, dates\n"
"		    etc).  It cannot modify the form.  This trigger for job\n"
"		    forms is run by 'p4 job' and 'p4 fix' (after the status\n"
"		    is updated), 'p4 change' (if the job is added or deleted)\n"
"		    and 'p4 submit' (if the job is associated with the change).\n"
"		    The 'form-commit' trigger has access to the new job name\n"
"		    created with 'p4 job', while the 'form-in' and 'form-save'\n"
"		    triggers are run before the job name is created.  The\n"
"		    special variable %%action%% is available on the job\n"
"		    'form-commit' trigger command line, and is expanded when\n"
"		    the job is modified by a fix.\n"
"\n"
"		form-delete:\n"
"		    Execute form trigger prior to delete of form after its\n"
"		    contents are parsed.\n"
"\n"
"		journal-rotate:\n"
"		    Execute journal rotation trigger after the journal has been\n"
"		    rotated and after the database has been unlocked.\n"
"\n"
"		journal-rotate-lock:\n"
"		    Execute journal rotation trigger after the journal has been\n"
"		    rotated, but before the database has been unlocked. All\n"
"		    commands against the server will wait for the trigger to\n"
"		    complete before running: do not run commands against the\n"
"		    server from this trigger.\n"
"\n"
"		shelve-submit:\n"
"		    Execute pre-shelve trigger after changelist has been\n"
"		    created but prior to file transfer. Also executed for\n"
"		    reshelve command.\n"
"\n"
"		shelve-commit:\n"
"		    Execute post-shelve trigger after files are shelved or\n"
"		    reshelved.\n"
"\n"
"		shelve-delete:\n"
"		    Execute shelve trigger prior to discarding shelved files.\n"
"\n"
"		push-submit:\n"
"		    Execute trigger during a push, fetch, or unzip operation,\n"
"		    after changelist has been created on the destination\n"
"		    server and files are locked but prior to file transfer.\n"
"\n"
"		push-content:\n"
"		    Execute trigger during a push, fetch, or unzip operation,\n"
"		    after file transfer but prior to commit. Files can be\n"
"		    accessed by the trigger using any of the 'p4 diff2',\n"
"		    'p4 files', 'p4 fstat', and 'p4 print' commands with\n"
"		    the revision specification '@=change', where 'change' is\n"
"		    the pending changelist number passed as %%changelist%%.\n"
"\n"
"		push-commit:\n"
"		    Execute trigger during a push, fetch, or unzip operation,\n"
"		    after changelist commit.\n"
"\n"
"	Path:   For change and submit triggers, a file pattern to match files\n"
"		in the changelist.  This file pattern can be an exclusion\n"
"		mapping (-pattern), to exclude files.  For form triggers, the\n"
"		name of the form (branch, client, etc).  For fix triggers\n"
"		'fix' is required as the path value.  For authentication\n"
"		triggers, 'auth' is required as the path value. For archive\n"
"		triggers, a file pattern to match the name of the file being\n"
"		accessed in the archive.  Note that, due to lazy copying when\n"
"		branching files, the name of the file in the archive can not\n"
"		be the same as the name of the file in the depot.  For command\n"
"		triggers, use the name of the command to match, e.g.\n"
"		'pre-user-$cmd' or a regular expression, e.g.\n"
"		'(pre|post)-user-add'. For journal rotation triggers, set the\n"
"		path value to 'any' if the trigger should run on all servers or\n"

"	The resubmit command resubmits changes which have been unsubmitted.\n"
"\n"
"	The resubmit command is typically used in one of two scenarios:\n"
"	- to resolve conflicting changes which were detected and\n"
"	  unsubmitted by running 'p4 fetch -t'.\n"
"	- to revise a set of changelists that you have submitted locally,\n"
"	  but have not pushed to any other server, and have unsubmitted.\n"
"\n"
"	If the -l flag is specified, resubmit lists all the unsubmitted\n"
"	changes but takes no action. This is useful as a way to preview\n"
"	the work that must be resubmitted.\n"
"\n"
"	There are three modes in which resubmit may run:\n"
"	- automatic\n"
"	- partially interactive\n"
"	- fully interactive\n"
"\n"
"	If the -m flag is specified, resubmit runs in automatic mode. The\n"
"	first thing resubmit -m does is to sync your workspace to #head.\n"
"	Then, resubmit -m processes each conflicting change, doing the\n"
"	following for each change:\n"
"	- sync\n"
"	- integrate tangent/...@=change dest/...\n"
"	- resolve -am\n"
"	- submit\n"
"\n"
"	If, for any change in the list, the 'resolve -am' processing detects\n"
"	merge conflicts in any file in that change, the resubmit command\n"
"	terminates at that point. All the files in that change which had\n"
"	merge conflicts are left unresolved. You must then run the resolve\n"
"	command to resolve the conflicts. Then run 'resubmit -R -m' to\n"
"	resume the resubmit process.\n"
"\n"
"	For all three resubmit modes, you can use the -R flag to resume the \n"
"	resubmit process once conflicts have been resolved. This flag causes \n"
"	resubmit to begin by submitting that fully-resolved change, after \n"
"	which it will proceed to the next unsubmitted change.\n"
"\n"
"	The -e flag runs resubmit in partially-interactive mode.\n"
"	The -e flag allows you to resolve each change, build and run tests,\n"
"	examine differences, etc., prior to submitting it,\n"
"	while the -i flag is a fully-interactive resubmission tool.\n"
"\n"
"	If the -e flag is specified, resubmit prepares the first (oldest)\n"
"	conflicting change, then exits. The files for the change are open\n"
"	in your workspace, but not resolved. You must then resolve the\n"
"	merges, reopen and modify already-resolved merges, or make any other\n"
"	necessary changes. You can additionally build and test the changes,\n"
"	inspect them, etc. When you are satisfied with this change, run \n"
"	'resubmit -R -e' to submit it and prepare the next conflicting change.\n"
"\n"
"	If the -i flag is specified, resubmit runs in fully interactive mode.\n"
"\n"
"	If a file path is also specified, interactive resubmit first\n"
"	unsubmits each change that modified a file in that path. If the -r\n"
"	flag is additionally specified, it names a remote spec. The mapping\n"
"	in the remote spec is then used to limit the files affected by the\n"
"	unsubmit operation. Thus a command such as 'p4 resubmit -r rmt @>=17'\n"
"	will affect only the files specified by the remote spec, not all\n"
"	files in the depot.\n"
"\n"
"	Resubmit -i then processes each conflicting change. For each change,\n"
"	resubmit displays summary information about the change, then\n"
"	offers the following prompts:\n"
"\n"
"	c		Modify the change description for this change\n"
"	m		Merge this change, then submit if no conflicts\n"
"	e		Merge this change, then exit for further editing\n"

"	                submit if no conflicts\n"
"	a		Add (squash) this change into the next conflicting\n"
"	                change\n"
"	s		Skip this change and move on to the next\n"
"	d		Delete this change without submitting it\n"
"	b		Begin again from the earliest remaining change\n"
"	l		List the changes remaining to be processed\n"
"	v		View the current change in short form\n"
"	V		View the current change with full diffs\n"
"	R		Display the status of resolved and unresolved merges\n"
"	q		Quit the resubmit operation\n"
"	?		Display (short) help during the resubmit command.\n"
"\n"
"	After choosing either 'e' or 'q', you can subsequently continue\n"
"	interactive resubmit by running 'resubmit -R -i'.\n"
"\n"
"	The interactive resubmit command is very flexible: you can reorder\n"
"	changes, combine changes, discard changes, etc.\n"
"\n"
"	When multiple changes are resubmitted by the resubmit command, the\n"
"	command will automatically switch to the correct stream at the start\n"
"	of resubmitting each change. This means that, when the command\n"
"	completes, your current stream may have been switched. You should\n"
"	then run 'p4 switch' and 'p4 switch -l' if necessary, and switch\n"
"	back to the desired stream before resuming your work.\n"
