/*
 * Diffsp.h - diff's sequence object
 *
 * The Sequence class implements the abstraction of a file as a sequence
 * of elements.  It's job is to count elements (lines) and compare them.
 *
 * To do comparisons quickly, Sequence builds in memory a list of hashes
 * and offsets for each line.  ProbablyEqual() compares this hash, which 
 * may return false positives.  Equal() must do the full check, actually 
 * looking at file contents.
 *
 * Sequence uses Sequencer, an abstract base class, for actual hashing 
 * and comparing: there are different Sequencer implementations for 
 * regular text files, files broken apart at whitespace, and files where
 * whitespace is ignored.  Which is selected by the flag to sequence.
 *
 * Sequence relies on ReadFile's ability to handle text files of different
 * line endings, and thus takes a LineType flag for CopyLines() and Dump().
 *
 * Classes defined:
 *
 *	Sequence - a file as an abstract sequence of elements
 *
 * Public methods:
 *
 *	Sequence::Sequence() - open file and hash lines
 *	Sequence::~Sequence() - close file
 *
 *	Sequence::Lines() - return # of lines read
 *	Sequence::SeekLink() - position ReadFile at given line
 *	Sequence::CopyLines() - copy given lines into buffer
 *	Sequence::Dump() - copy given lines into FILE
 *	Sequence::Length() - return raw length of lines
 *	Sequence::Equal() - return whether lines are identical
 *	Sequence::ProbablyEqual() - return false if lines are not identical
 *
 * Private classed:
 *
 *	Sequencer - abstract base utility class for parsing file
 *	VarInfo - single line's hash and offset
 *
 * Private methods:
 *
 *	Sequence::GrowLineBuf() - grow hash/offset list table
 *	Sequence::StoreLine() - add hash/offset to list
 *	Sequencer::Load() - build list of hashed lines
 *	Sequencer::Equal() - compare two lines
